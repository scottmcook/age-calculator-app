## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For utility classes
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - For deployment

### What I learned

#### [The number input is the worst input](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/12/26/why-the-number-input-is-the-worst-input/)

I thought it would be helpful to use the built in html element attributes but found this approach has its shortcomings.

**Cons**

- When the number input contains an invalid value and you retrieve the value, you get a blank string
- If you set a min / max for the number input type it can easily be bypassed.

**Pros**

- If you need a number input that has no conditional validation (i.e. number is always within a certain range of min/max) and has no relationship with any other inputs on the form, then using the number input is not a big deal.

The only net benefit of using this type is some browsers include the up and down arrows for accessibility.
